**I am a data editor and data visualization designer based in Pordenone, Italy. I've been working with data for a couple of years, since when I ended my master's degree in Publishing and Journalism in Verona. I've moved gradually from classic written-journalism to data journalism and now data analysis / data science.** 

### Data visualization (ðŸ‘‰ check my [portfolio](https://daniloderosa.netlify.app/portfolio/))

I've been collaborating with the newspaper of my region ([_Messaggero Veneto_](https://messaggeroveneto.gelocal.it/udine)) since November 2020: for them I've researched, analyzed and visualized various datasets, always with a focused view on the local interest. 

Besides working as a freelance, I enjoy spending some time participating in data viz challenges, like #tidytuesday, #makeovermonday and #swdchallenge. 

#### Favourite tools

The tools that I use the most are R and Tableau Public, although I'm starting to experiment a little more with D3.js. Usually when I do stuff with R (using RStudio and the big universe of tidyverse, including ggplot2) I'll post the code on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/daniloderosa); here's [my profile on Tableau Public](http://public.tableau.com/profile/danilo6525#!/). Depending on what I'm doing, I also tend to use Datawrapper, Flourish, QGIS and Adobe Illustrator. 

### Personal info 

I'm 25. I love dogs (especially my 6-years-old Labrador-Border collie mix), mountains, tennis, Formula 1, football and my girlfriend: not in this particular order, by the way.
