A glimpse of some dataviz I've realized both for work and for personal fun (often participating in challenges like [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) and [#MakeoverMonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/)). 

When the title reports that the chart is interactive, you can click on it and check the interactive version on [my Tableau Public's profile](http://public.tableau.com/profile/danilo6525#!/).

Most of these charts are in italian (my native language): if you're not an italian speaker, I'm really sorry about that. I'm already working on updating more charts in english.
